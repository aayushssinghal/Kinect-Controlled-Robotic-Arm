Kinect captures the movement and gestures of hand and body using its various sensors.
Robotic arm is controlled remotely using ZigBee wireless interface. Computer receives hand
movements from the kinect sensor and translates it to a particular command and sends that
command to Robotic arm. Robotic arm looks as if, it is imitating the hand movement.
In order to make the system completely remote control, a camera may be mounted on the
top of robotic arm. So that user can view the environment of robotic arm from distance.
Connection to Robotic arm can also be established without using ZigBee wireless device, and
through a wired connection, because Robotic arm is kept stationary at all times.
